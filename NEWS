* Bug Fixes and Changes
** 3.1.6

   + Fixed a bug in predict() -- function not works as intended.
   
** 3.1.5

   + Added working examples.
   
** 3.1.4

   + Change to depend on the parallel package instead of snow.
   
** 3.1.3

   + Test Mac bootstrap bug.
   
** 3.1.2

   + Removed MASS from Imports section of DESCRIPTION file.
   + Removed cluster.setup() in do_snow() to eliminate the library() calls.
   + Fix bootstrap sampling. Response was not being sampled, resulting in
     garbage estimates.
  
** 3.1.1

   + Bumped version requirement for optimx (>= 2013.8.6) to solve some
     compatibility issues.

* New Features
** 3.1.0 (Initial release)

   IMPORTANT NOTE: boolean3 represents a complete re-write of the previous
   boolean package. As a consequence of this, compatibility with previous
   versions of boolean have been broken. The important changes between previous
   releases and boolean3 are listed below.

   + Removed dependence on Zelig.
   + Changed the method of specifying the model to me more consistent with the
     style of other R packages.
   + Greatly improved performance. Many models can be estimated in 1/10th the
     time, or better, when compared to the original boolean package.
   + Added support for the optimizing methods available in the optimx
     package. This includes the ability to apply box constraints, which can be
     useful in maximizing boolean likelihoods.
   + Support for MCMC estimation was dropped.
   + Support for skewed logit (scobit) link functions has been removed (for the
     time being).
   + Added multiprocessor/cluster support for bootstrapping using the parallel
     package.
   + Genetic optimization using rgenoud also provides support for clustering
     with parallel.
   + Plotting of predicted probabilities and likelihood profiles is now done
     with lattice.
