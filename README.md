boolean3
========

boolean3 represents a substantial re-write of the original boolean package
developed by Bear Braumoeller, Ben Goodrich, and Jacob Kline. This version was
developed by Jason Morhan under the direction of Bear Braumoeller and with
support from The Ohio State University's College of Social and Behavioral
Sciences.
